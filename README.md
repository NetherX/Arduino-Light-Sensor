# Telebackup
Telebackup is a simple program which main purpose is to backup your Telegram conversations, being able to analyse them with statics that vary from the day with more messages or displaying who sent more messages, etc.

## Before using
Please keep in mind this program is still in an *early beta stage* and beta testers are required before the program is finished. It probably contains major bugs, so use with caution. Although it's a beta, you won't lose your contacts, Telegram account, or any chat. This program *only* downloads your messages and stores them in a file.

### What Telebackup can do
- Download your messages from any individual chat or group
- Export the conversation in HTML format or as plain text files

### What Telebackup can't do (yet)
- Download media. This is still a WIP

## Credits
Thanks to @sochix for his repository TLSharp. This uses his code, with some other implementations, in order to download the chats.
